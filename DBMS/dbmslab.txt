Create a Function named GetDepartmentManagerName(p_dept_id) that accepts a department ID and returns the full name of the employee who is the manager of that department.

Create a Procedure named PromoteToManager(p_emp_id). This procedure will:

Find the dept_id of the employee specified by p_emp_id.

Update the Departments table to set the manager_id for that department to p_emp_id.

Update the Employees table to set the is_manager flag to TRUE for that employee.

(Optional Challenge): Find the old manager of the department (if one existed) and set their is_manager flag to FALSE.

Create a Trigger named prevent_manager_transfer that fires BEFORE UPDATE on the Employees table. This trigger must enforce the following business rule:

Check if the employee being updated is currently a manager (OLD.is_manager is TRUE).

Check if the update is attempting to change their department (OLD.dept_id <> NEW.dept_id).

If both conditions are true, the trigger must stop the operation and SIGNAL a custom error with the message, "A manager cannot be transferred to another department. Demote them first."




create table employees(empid INT PRIMARY KEY,empname VARCHAR(10),ismanager BOOLEAN,deptid INT ,FOREIGN KEY(deptid) references department(deptid));

create table departmentdeptid INT PRIMARY KEY,deptnameVARCHAR(10),managerid INT,FOREIGN KEY(managerid) references employees(empid));


first, you create the tables, and second, you insert the data in a specific order.
Create the employees table without the foreign key constraint.
Create the department table with its foreign key. This works because the employees table now exists.
CREATE TABLE employees (
    empid INT PRIMARY KEY,
    empname VARCHAR(10),
    ismanager BOOLEAN,
    deptid INT
);
CREATE TABLE department (
    deptid INT PRIMARY KEY,
    deptname VARCHAR(10),
    managerid INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (managerid) REFERENCES employees(empid)
);
Add the missing foreign key to the employees table using ALTER TABLE
ALTER TABLE employees
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_dept
FOREIGN KEY (deptid) REFERENCES department(deptid);
ALTER TABLE employees DROP FOREIGN KEY fk_dept;

Inserting the Data
To insert data, you must temporarily break the dependency by using NULL for a foreign key. This requires that the foreign key columns (managerid and deptid) are allowed to be NULL.

Insert an employee but leave their deptid as NULL. This employee will be the first manager.

SQL

-- Let's say the CEO (empid 101) is created first and isn't in a department yet
INSERT INTO employees(empid, empname, ismanager, deptid) VALUES (101, 'Alice', TRUE, NULL);
Insert a department and assign that employee as the manager. This works because the employee (ID 101) now exists.

SQL

INSERT INTO department(deptid, deptname, managerid) VALUES (1, 'HR', 101);
Finally, update the first employee to place them in the department you just created.

SQL

UPDATE employees SET deptid = 1 WHERE empid = 101;
By following this order, you satisfy the foreign key constraints at each step.


Other Method
-- Step 1: Disable the foreign key checks
SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS = 0;

-- Step 2: Insert the data. The order doesn't matter now.
-- You can insert the department first...
INSERT INTO department(deptid, deptname, managerid) VALUES (1, 'HR', 101);

-- ...and then insert the employee, even though the department didn't exist when the check was on.
INSERT INTO employees(empid, empname, ismanager, deptid) VALUES (101, 'Alice', TRUE, 1);

-- Step 3: Re-enable the foreign key checks for all future operations
SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS = 1;
